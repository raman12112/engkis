On the western edge of the Amazon River, there is a proposal to construct a road. This road would connect the remote town of Cruzeiro do Sul, Brazil, with the larger city of Pucallpa, Peru. The construction of the road has become a subject of contentious debate. Proponents of the road claimed that it would provide an efficient way for rural farmers and tradesmen to get their goods to city markets. They claimed it would also allow loggers to more easily transport timber from the depths of the Amazon rainforest to sawmills. From the sawmills in Pucallpa, goods could be transported to Peru’s Pacific coast and shipped to international buyers. Call:- 1-202-9782-1488 Critics of the Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road, however, argue that it would cut right through traditional territories of the Ashéninka, an indigenous people of eastern Peru. Many leaders fear the road will increase access to previously undeveloped rainforest, threatening the ecosystem and the Ashéninka way of life. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Large trees, such as mahogany, for example, will catch the eye of illegal loggers because of their high market value. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 The great mahogany trees also serve as protection to the Ashéninka from the outside world and are essential for the health of the Amazonian rainforest. The trees provide shelter, food, and nesting grounds that sustain the vast biodiversity within the ecosystem, an ecosystem the Ashéninka have come to depend on for their own food, shelter, and life sustenance. Geography The Amazon Basin is located in South America, covering an area of seven million square kilometers (2.7 million square miles). Nearly 70 percent of the basin falls within Brazil with remaining areas stretching into parts of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guyana. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 The Amazon’s massive drainage basin is made of dozens of smaller watersheds, including the Tamaya. Its watershed lies at the headwaters of the Purus and Juruá Rivers, near the border of Peru and Brazil. The Ashéninka people have lived in this region for centuries, surviving on game, fish, and cultivated crops, such as yucca roots, sweet potato, corn, coffee, and sugar cane. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Background The rainforest surrounding the Amazon is the largest on the entire planet. In addition to 33 million human inhabitants, including 385 distinct Indigenous groups, it hosts the greatest diversity of plant and animal life in the world. More than two million species of insects are native to the region, including many tree-living species and hundreds of spiders and butterflies. Primates are abundant—including howler, spider, and capuchin monkeys—along with sloths, snakes, and iguanas. Brightly colored parrots, toucans, and parakeets are just some of the region’s native birds. Many of these species are unique to the Amazon rainforest, which means they cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 At a global level, the Amazon rainforest helps to regulate climate and acts as a carbon sink for greenhouse gases. At a national level, the Amazon is considered a source of energy and income, based on production and commercialization of raw materials. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Some of the most valued tree species in the world thrive in the rainforest. Mahogany is one of the most valuable resources from the Amazon forest. The tree’s rich, red grain and durability make it one of the most coveted building materials in the world. A single mahogany tree can fetch thousands of U.S. dollars on the international market. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Even though logging is prohibited in much of the Amazon River, it is legal in some areas in large part because the sale of the wood is so lucrative. The high demand for mahogany has left many of Peru’s watersheds—such as the Tamaya—stripped of their most valuable trees. Without large trees, and their roots, the watershed risks heavy flooding and soil erosion. Call:- 1-202-9782-1488 Conflict The Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road is part of a larger development plan to link South America’s remote, isolated economies through new transportation, energy, and telecommunications projects. Tension exists between communities that favor developing the rural economies of the Amazon Basin and those who favor preserving its forested areas and diversity of life. The Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (IIRSA) is a proposal for the construction of several highways throughout the continent, five of them within the western Amazon Basin. The Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road is one such proposed highway. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Supporters of the Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road say international demand for Amazonian resources could help develop the rural economies that are scattered throughout the basin. In addition to providing a route of access for rural goods to enter the global market, the road will allow members of rural communities to access better health care, education, and welfare. This could lead to improved living conditions, healthier lifestyles, and longer life spans. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Conservationists are concerned that infrastructure such as the Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road will devastate an already weakened Amazonian ecosystem, as road access is highly correlated with deforestation. In Brazil, for instance, 80 percent of deforestation occurs within 48.28 kilometers (30 miles) of a road. Critics argue that the construction of a road along the Brazil-Peru corridor will provide easier access for loggers to reach mahogany and other trees. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Indigenous communities like the Ashéninka will also be affected. These communities have largely chosen to maintain a traditional way of life, and conservationists are concerned that the Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road may expose them to disease and land theft. Call:- 1-202-9782-1488 Identification of Stakeholders Indigenous Communities: Members of the Ashéninka community are trying to protect the forest and their native lands. Yet, like other Indigenous communities in the area, they are in turmoil, largely divided between those favoring conservation and those seeking greater economic opportunities. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 While the Ashéninka want to preserve their culture and connections to the forest, they also need access to things like clothes, soap, and medicine. The road could establish trade routes that make these goods more accessible. However, isolated peoples could be exposed to disease and land theft. Call:-1-202-9782-1488 Wildlife: The proposed Pucallpa-Cruzeiro do Sul road runs through Serra do Divisor National Park, Brazil, and other reserves that are home to threatened and rare species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. For some of these species, such as the spider monkey and red howler monkey, the construction of the road could make their populations vulnerable to fragmentation and more visible to hunters. As mahogany and other canopy giants are removed, any wildlife that relies on the trees for shelter, nesting, or food will need to relocate.
